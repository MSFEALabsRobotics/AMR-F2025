Navigation:
pwd               # Print current directory (where you are)
ls                # List files in the current directory
ls -l             # Long format (shows permissions, size, dates)
ls -a             # Show hidden files (start with .)
cd folder_name    # Change directory into a folder
cd ..             # Go up one folder
cd /              # Go to root directory
cd ~              # Go to home directory

Working with files & folders:
mkdir myfolder              # Make a new folder
rmdir myfolder              # Remove an empty folder
nano file.txt               # Edit a file inside the terminal
cat file.txt                # Show file contents
cp file.txt copy.txt        # Copy file
mv file.txt newname.txt     # Rename/move file
rm file.txt                 # Delete file


Package management (APT):
sudo apt update                  # Refresh list of packages
sudo apt upgrade                 # Update all installed packages
sudo apt install packagename     # Install software
sudo apt remove packagename      # Remove software
