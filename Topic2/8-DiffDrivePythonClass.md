# ðŸš— Differential Drive Kinematics â€“ Python Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to implement and use a simple **differential drive kinematics class** in Python.  
We separate the code into two files:

## 1. Create the Class File

Create a file called **`diff_drive.py`**:

```python
# diff_drive.py

import math

class DiffDriveKinematics:
    def __init__(self, wheel_radius=0.05, wheel_base=0.2):
        self.r = wheel_radius   # wheel radius [m]
        self.L = wheel_base     # distance between wheels [m]

        # Robot pose (x, y, theta)
        self.x = 0.0
        self.y = 0.0
        self.theta = 0.0   # [rad]

    def forward(self, w_r, w_l):
        """
        Forward kinematics:
        From wheel angular speeds (rad/s) -> robot (v, omega)
        """
        v_r = self.r * w_r
        v_l = self.r * w_l
        v = (v_r + v_l) / 2.0
        omega = (v_r - v_l) / self.L
        return v, omega

    def inverse(self, v, omega):
        """
        Inverse kinematics:
        From robot (v, omega) -> wheel angular speeds (rad/s)
        """
        v_r = v + (self.L / 2.0) * omega
        v_l = v - (self.L / 2.0) * omega
        w_r = v_r / self.r
        w_l = v_l / self.r
        return w_r, w_l

    def update_pose(self, w_r, w_l, dt):
        """
        Update the robot pose by integrating velocity over time.
        """
        v, omega = self.forward(w_r, w_l)

        self.x += v * math.cos(self.theta) * dt
        self.y += v * math.sin(self.theta) * dt
        self.theta += omega * dt

        return self.x, self.y, self.theta
```

## 2. Use the Class in Another Script

Create a second file called **`test_diff.py`** in the same folder:

```python
# test_diff.py
from diff_drive import DiffDriveKinematics

# Create a robot model
robot = DiffDriveKinematics(wheel_radius=0.05, wheel_base=0.2)

# Example 1: Forward kinematics
v, omega = robot.forward(w_r=10, w_l=10)
print("Forward Kinematics:")
print(f"  v = {v:.2f} m/s, omega = {omega:.2f} rad/s")

# Example 2: Inverse kinematics
w_r, w_l = robot.inverse(v=0.5, omega=0.5)
print("\nInverse Kinematics:")
print(f"  w_r = {w_r:.2f} rad/s, w_l = {w_l:.2f} rad/s")
```

---

## 3. Robot Pose from Velocity

This is the integration.  
It allows us to track the robotâ€™s path (odometry) from wheel speeds.

---

## 4. Pose Tracking Example

```python
# pose_demo.py
import time
from diff_drive import DiffDriveKinematics

robot = DiffDriveKinematics()

dt = 0.1  # timestep [s]

# Drive forward for 2 seconds
for i in range(20):
    x, y, theta = robot.update_pose(w_r=10, w_l=10, dt=dt)
    print(f"t={i*dt:.1f}s -> x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, theta={theta:.2f}")
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

This will show the robot moving **straight ahead**.

## 5. Exercise â€“ Two Robots, Same Wheel Rotations

Letâ€™s compare two robots with **the same wheel rotations**, but different sequences:

- **Robot 1**: Drives forward, then turns right.  
- **Robot 2**: Turns right, then drives forward.  

Even though the wheels rotate the same total amount, the **final poses are different**!

```python
# two_robots.py
from diff_drive import DiffDriveKinematics
import math

dt = 0.1
steps_forward = 20   # forward motion steps
steps_turn = 20      # turning motion steps

# Robot 1: Forward then Right
robot1 = DiffDriveKinematics()
for _ in range(steps_forward):
    robot1.update_pose(w_r=10, w_l=10, dt=dt)  # straight
for _ in range(steps_turn):
    robot1.update_pose(w_r=10, w_l=-10, dt=dt) # rotate

# Robot 2: Right then Forward
robot2 = DiffDriveKinematics()
for _ in range(steps_turn):
    robot2.update_pose(w_r=10, w_l=-10, dt=dt) # rotate
for _ in range(steps_forward):
    robot2.update_pose(w_r=10, w_l=10, dt=dt)  # straight

print("\nFinal Poses:")
print(f"Robot 1 -> x={robot1.x:.2f}, y={robot1.y:.2f}, theta={math.degrees(robot1.theta):.1f}Â°")
print(f"Robot 2 -> x={robot2.x:.2f}, y={robot2.y:.2f}, theta={math.degrees(robot2.theta):.1f}Â°")
```

### Expected result

- **Robot 1** ends up in front of its starting point, then rotated right.  
- **Robot 2** rotates first, then drives forward in the new direction.  
- Both robots had **identical wheel motions**, but ended up at different places.

## âœ… Summary

- **Forward kinematics**: wheel speeds â†’ \((v, \omega)\).  
- **Inverse kinematics**: \((v, \omega)\) â†’ wheel speeds.  
- **Pose integration**: updates \((x, y, \theta)\) over time.  
- The **sequence of motions matters** â€” order of straight vs turning leads to different final poses, even if wheel rotations are the same.
