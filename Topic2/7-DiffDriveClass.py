# ðŸš— Differential Drive Kinematics â€“ Python Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to implement and use a simple **differential drive kinematics class** in Python.  
We separate the code into two files:

---

## 1. Create the Class File

Create a file called **`diff_drive.py`**:

```python
# diff_drive.py

class DiffDriveKinematics:
    def __init__(self, wheel_radius=0.05, wheel_base=0.2):
        self.r = wheel_radius   # wheel radius [m]
        self.L = wheel_base     # distance between wheels [m]

    def forward(self, w_r, w_l):
        """
        Forward kinematics:
        From wheel angular speeds (rad/s) -> robot (v, omega)
        """
        v_r = self.r * w_r
        v_l = self.r * w_l
        v = (v_r + v_l) / 2.0
        omega = (v_r - v_l) / self.L
        return v, omega

    def inverse(self, v, omega):
        """
        Inverse kinematics:
        From robot (v, omega) -> wheel angular speeds (rad/s)
        """
        v_r = v + (self.L / 2.0) * omega
        v_l = v - (self.L / 2.0) * omega
        w_r = v_r / self.r
        w_l = v_l / self.r
        return w_r, w_l
```

---

## 2. Use the Class in Another Script

Create a second file called **`test_diff.py`** in the same folder:

```python
# test_diff.py
from diff_drive import DiffDriveKinematics  # import the class

# Create a robot model
robot = DiffDriveKinematics(wheel_radius=0.05, wheel_base=0.2)

# Example 1: Forward kinematics
v, omega = robot.forward(w_r=10, w_l=10)
print("Forward Kinematics:")
print(f"  v = {v:.2f} m/s, omega = {omega:.2f} rad/s")

# Example 2: Inverse kinematics
w_r, w_l = robot.inverse(v=0.5, omega=0.5)
print("\nInverse Kinematics:")
print(f"  w_r = {w_r:.2f} rad/s, w_l = {w_l:.2f} rad/s")
```

---

## 3. Run the Example

In terminal, run:

```bash
python3 test_diff.py
```

Expected output:

```
Forward Kinematics:
  v = 0.50 m/s, omega = 0.00 rad/s

Inverse Kinematics:
  w_r = 12.00 rad/s, w_l = 8.00 rad/s
```

---

## âœ… Summary

- **Forward kinematics** converts **wheel speeds â†’ robot velocity**.  
- **Inverse kinematics** converts **robot velocity â†’ wheel speeds**.  
- Keep the class in `diff_drive.py` and import it wherever you need it.

This forms the basis for simulating and controlling differential drive robots.
